## 

Thank you for using the Jumping Spider Disco Floor, the first _and only_ research tool designed to create a temperature differential between spiders whilst they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54LgyqSPfsQ" target="_blank">get it on</a>. It is also the first research tool ever whose documentation references Marvin Gaye.

The [Quick Reference]({{< relref "quick-reference/index.md" >}}) will guide you through the capabilities, setup, and general use of the system, while the [User Manual]({{< relref "user-manual/index.md" >}}) is an homage to laboratory instrument user manuals of yesteryear, our attempt to enable the user to understand, tweak, troubleshoot, and hack the system.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed under the auspices of Drs. Erin Brandt and [Damian Elias](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/damian-elias) of [UC Berkeley's Elias Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/eliaslab/) for spider research, and with extensive work by fellow multi-disciplinary engineer [Alex Izvorski](https://github.com/aizvorski). All are fantastic  researchers and this work would not have been possible without their help.

Additional thanks is due to the teams behind the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) and [flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) Python projects, and this documentation site was built using the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Alabaster theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme) (licensed under [BSD](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).
